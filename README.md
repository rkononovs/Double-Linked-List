# Double-Linked-List

My coursework for my module: Object-Oriented Programming C++.

This program implements a basic Double Linked List.

This list can do these Mutating Operations:

Add an element to the front of the list, Add an element before the current element, Add an element after the current element, Remove the first element in the list, Remove the last element in the list, Sort the list.

This list can do these non-Mutating Operations:

Check whether list is empty, Give the number of elements in the list, Look at the first element in the list (head), Look at the last element in the list (tail), Look at the current element in the list, Traverse the current element backwards, Traverse the current element forwards.
